> ### ReasonML with GraphQL codebase containing real world examples that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo API](https://reasonml-graphql.now.sh)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **ReasonML, GraphQL** including graphql mutations and queries, authentication, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **ReasonML, GraphQL** community styleguides & best practices.
